## Book Agro-Consultant
Farmers have to pay a fixed price of ethers to agricultural Consultants(For eg:0.0015 ethers)  from the list of available consultants on their respective homepages.  Farmers have to choose 1 agricultural consultant per crop.  Each consultation will issue codes both to the agricultural consultant as well as the farmer. These codes are used to establish trust among the agricultural consultant and the farmer in the application.  To link a crop to the consultation, a farmer has to add his code while creating a new crop.  This will connect all further consultations of this crop to a particular consulted agricultural consultant contract. The contract established here will be used in order to add ratings and performance indicators and changing states of the crops.

The amount deducted from the farmer's account will be credited to the smart contract and not to the agricultural consultant directly. The consultant will receive the ethers only when the crop reaches its final state and all the duties of the agricultural consultant are completed. Then the amount will be transferred from the smart contract to the agricultural consultantâ€™s account.

If any party has complaints, they can raise a complaint and if a complaint on a contract is active then the amount will be held by the smart contract and not transferred until a certain period of time or the complaint gets resolved. If the complaint doesn't get resolved the transaction will be reverted and the amount will be sent back to the farmer. The amount to be charged for consultation as well as the duration of holding the amount under a circumstance of complaint raised will be decided by the governing authority and can only be increased or decreased by these authorities.
