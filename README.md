# Farmer

## Book Agro-Consultant

A farmer will be provided with the list of Agro-Consultants and he can choose and book one from the list. Booking a consultant is followed with the transfer of payment. And the farmer will be provided with a key and he should use this key while adding the crop.

## Add Security Deposit

If the farmer wants public funding functionality in their crops they have to start by depositing a certain amount of ethers as a security deposit.  The security deposit shall be used when the sales on the crop return losses. Farmers can request a maximum of 50\% of the security deposit they have invested in the application for their crops as public funds across all crops, which most likely increases their productivity by 33\%. Farmers can increase or decrease the security deposit on their account, based on the number of active fundings on the crops yet to be sold and have availed for funding.

## Propose new crop

The prerequisite for creating a new crop is that farmers should get a contract with the agricultural consultant. This contract will issue codes to both farmers and agricultural consultants. The code issued to farmers has to be added to the new crop along with the user ID of the agricultural consultant to connect the contract to the new crop being created. A new crop requires the following details: 

1)  Crop ID
2)  Crop variant
3)  Crop type
4)  Crop duration
5)  Agricultural consultant user ID
6)  Contract code
7)  If chosen yes, a maximum amount of funding required

## Buy Supplies

All the required products can be brought from the supplier and they will make payment through ethers.
